Portfilo submission for 6/12/15
i am submitting my client and server cocket with the research and all the java files. i have finally figured out how to use git hub.
they are located under personal work, then java then their respective folders.
included is all my other java files that i have done and my use case document. 
i am really proud that i got the server and client socket to work. it has really helped my understanding of the way programs communicate back to a main server for ads or other features.

here is the link for the teaching video that we grabbed derrek hodges who is in the class but not our group to join us. he said he learned alot and understood he needed to get his act in gear.
