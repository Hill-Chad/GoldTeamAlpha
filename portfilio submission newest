Portfilo submission for 6/23/15
i am submitting my client and server socket. i have also included JUNIT and its interaction with the client and server socket.

they are located under personal work, then java then their respective folders.

i have done my use case document. it is located under UML. i have also updated all my uml stuff

i finally got the JUNIT to work. i used a youtube video made by some kid. it was humbling to say the least that some kid was able to teach me. (here is a link to the video, he explainsd it really well https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEJAl-9Kt30)

i am really proud that i got the server and client socket to work with the JUnit. it has really helped my understanding of the way to test and validate the programs.

here is my application controller pattern teaching video. we havent done another video since one of our group memebers has been busy with moving to utah.
